## Removing Pods and Gateways
* We know a given `node` is not a residential gateway if `node.residentialGateway = false`
* Precedence between `remove_gateway_enabled` and `remove_pod_enabled`
  * If `remove_gateway_enabled == FALSE`, then user cannot see the option to remove a Node that is a residential gateway
  * If `remove_gateway_enabled == TRUE`, then user can see the option to remove a Node that is a residential gateway
  * If `remove_gateway_enabled == EMPTY | NULL` or doesn’t exist, then user can see the option to remove a Node that is a residential gateway
* Nodes that are residential gateways are not affected by `remove_pod_enabled` feature flag
  * if `remove_pod_enabled == false` but `remove_gateway_enabled == true`, user should be able to remove the Gateway
* Nodes that are not residential gateways are not affected by `remove_gateway_enabled` feature flag
  * If `remove_gateway_enabled == false` but `remove_pod_enabled == true`, user should be able to remove the Pod
